The proposed Ultra Gain Cubic (UGC) converter is simulated in PSIM platform with a output voltage of 325 V and power rating 300 W.

The proposed UGC has the following advantages

The UGC converter has the following benefits over existing topologies
 1. Ultra gain is achieved with  minimum  number of components.
 2. To get cubic gains,  only one switch is needed.
 3. The proposed converter provides a theoretical gain of 125 at d @ 0.8.
 4. Without using any transformer or coupled inductors, the proposed UGC converter attaining higher gains. So high power density and overall cost is low.
 5. Input current continuous, high efficiency (>90\%), input and output are connected to same ground, are some additional advantages of the  UGC converter.
 
Working operation:

The operation of the converter in continuous conduction mode (CCM), discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), boundary condition mode (BCM) were explained
and necessary  equations were derived. The CCM operation is verified through simulations results and hardware results.
